# Kitties R' Us 

Kitties R' Us is a decentralized Application for collecting, creating and trading NFT kitties.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project was to learn about creating NFT based dApps. 

- I learned a lot about the ERC-721 standard, writing and executing well constructed unit tests and deploying to the Binance Smart Chain testnet using Truffle. 
- I also strengthened my html, css and js frontend skills.

Overall, this project was fun, challenging and a great learning experience for me. I now understand the importance of documentation, code-readability and organization.
